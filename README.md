# Fox-game ðŸ¦Š
A full-featured digital pet game build with HTML, CSS, Javascript.
Thanks to Frontendmasters and Brian Holt. 
The aim is to keep your fox alive by keeping it fed and clean.
Failure to do so will result in death ðŸ’€
## Available Commands
### npm run dev
Start a local development Server (defaults to http://localhost:1234)
### npm run format
Format app to prettier specifications.
## Code Style:
I have set up prettier to auto format this project. The scripts are set up so that if there were any team members they could run 'npm run format' to auto format their own documents accordingly.
